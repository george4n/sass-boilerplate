- components/: For small components, buttons, and similar styling.
- layout/: Styling for larger layout components; e.g. header, footer, etc.
- pages/: Specific styles for individual pages.
- themes/: Different themes for the application.
- abstracts/: Sass tools, helpers, variables, and function files.
- vendors/: External libraries and CSS.
- main.scss: The primary SASS file which imports everything.
